    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am Fangel Chan, and I am a complete newbie at website design. I am a senior in ATEC who transferred from Collin College as a freshman/sophomore halfway after a semester, am taking this course to complete my degree for Emerging Media Arts. I like cute and silly stuff.</p>
    <p>I do struggle in working on HTMLs like I have done previously in college, but I will do my best nevertheless.</p> <br>
